Basic theory and applications of complex analytic functions of one variable: exponential and logarithmic function, Cauchy-Riemann Equations, analytic functions, Cauchy-Goursat theorem, harmonic functions, Taylor series, line integral, Laurent power series, computing contour integrals and special integrals by Cauchy's residue theory.

There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.
* Complex Variables and Applications, J. Brown and R. Churchill, 9th edition.
* Complex Analysis with Applications, R. Silverman, 2006.
* Complex analysis, E.M. Stein and Shakarchi, 2003.
