Introduces topology, covering topics fundamental to modern analysis and geometry. Topological spaces and continuous functions, connectedness, compactness, separation axioms, function spaces, metrization theorems, embedding theorems and the fundamental group.

There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.
* Topology, James Munkres, 2014.
* [Introduction to Topology, MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/index.htm).
* [Lecture notes on Topology, John Rognes, 2010](http://folk.uio.no/rognes/kurs/mat4500h10/topology.pdf).
