Basic Topology, Countability & Separation Axioms, The Tychonoff Theorems, Metrization Theorems, Complete Metric Space & Function spaces, Baire Spaces & Dimension Theory

There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.
* Topology, James Munkres, 2014.
* [Introduction to Topology, MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/index.htm).
* [Lecture notes on Topology, John Rognes, 2010](http://folk.uio.no/rognes/kurs/mat4500h10/topology.pdf).
