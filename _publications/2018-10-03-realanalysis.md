Measure theory and the theory of Lebesgue integration, signed Measures and differentiation, elements of functional analysis, Hilbert space, Banach space, L<sup>p</sup> space, Fourier transform.  

I audited the undergraduate course **Real Analysis (881.425)** in spring 2017 and the graduate course **Real Analysis (3341.503)** in spring 2018, both held at Seoul National University. Since it is an essential subject, I studied it again by solving the textbook problems.  

To strengthen the understanding of the subject, I have completed all of the lecture assignments from the lecture **MATH 114 Analysis II: Measure, Integration and Banach Spaces** held at **Harvard University** in Fall 2013. I would like to thank **Professor Jacob Lurie** for providing the lecture materials.

There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.
* Real and Complex Analysis, Walter Rudin, 1987.
* Real Analysis, Gerald B. Folland, 1999.
* Real Analysis, H. Royden, 4th edition.
* Lecture notes on Real Analysis (Graduate Stanford Math 205A), Lenya Ryzhik, 2014.
