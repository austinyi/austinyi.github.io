Basic algebraic structures like groups, rings and fields, and their properties.  

There are few textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.
* A first course in abstract algebra, J.B. Fraleigh, 2003.
* [Lecture notes on Modern Algebra, MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-703-modern-algebra-spring-2013/lecture-notes/).
* Abstract Algebra â€“ Theory and Applications, Thomas W. Judson, 2015.
