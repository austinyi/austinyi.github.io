Analyzed the causal relationship between mental illness and crime using Markov equivalence class of DAGs  

Causal questions are fundamental in all parts of science. The answer to the question "Why causation?" is almost immediate as the answer to the question "Why statistics?" Casuality is treated important in statistics and various disciplines, especially in economics and the behavior, social, and biomedical sciences. For a stronger motivation for studying causation, I hope you to examine one of the most intriguing phenomenon in the statistical literature: Simpson's paradox.

For those of you who are new to this paradox, I hope you will realize a signficiant deal by looking at these two figures.  

I was motivated by some causal questions. For example, "  ?"; " ?"


There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.

* Causal Inference in Statistics: An overview, J. Pearl, 2009.  
* Causal Inference Using Graphical Models with the R Package pcalg, M. Maathuis, 2012.
