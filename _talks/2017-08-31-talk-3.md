Forecast the fine dust concentration in Seoul by using Dynamic Linear Models  

Fine dust is airborne with many complex components and invisible to our eyes. Fine dust consists of tiny particles with diameters of less than 10 micrometers. It is a potential cause for respiratory diseases and increases the risk of cancer. The fine dust problem in South Korea has become very serious over the past three years. Seoul has already introduced emergency measures, such as limiting vehicle use and cutting the amount of dust generated by building sites and power plants; however, they have had only a little success.  

Nowadays, the accuracy of fine dust forecasts has become very important. In this project, I presented a model for predicting fine dust concentration in Seoul. Using Dynamic Linear Model (DLM), I succeeded in achieving better performance than the most widely-used ARIMA models in time series analysis.  

This project is supervised by Prof. Jaeyong Lee at Seoul National University.

There are several textbooks and references that I used to study this subject, which are following.  
* Dynamic Linear Models with R, G. Petris & S. Petrone, 2009.
* Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods, J. Durbin & S. J. Koopman, 2012.
* A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods, Peter D. Hoff, 2009.
