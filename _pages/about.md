Welcome to my site!  

I am Bongsoo Yi, a first-year Statistics PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Seoul National University.


My current interest includes:  
* Statistics
  * Statistical Machine Learning, Nonparametric Statistics, High dimensional Statistics, Bayesian Statistics
* Computer Science
  * Algorithm Engineering, Deep Learning

Also, I am working hard and having fun strengthening my [mathematical](https://austinyi.github.io/notes/) background these days.
Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing soccer and watching MLB and EPL on TV.

Feel free to email me at bongsoo (at) unc (dot) edu. A copy of my CV is available [here](https://austinyi.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).
