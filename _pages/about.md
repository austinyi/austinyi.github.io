Welcome to my site!  

I am Bongsoo Yi, a first-year PhD candidate in Statistics at Seoul National University. I left for 2 years due to mandatory military service after one semester. I am currently working at Songpa District Office (Jul. 2018 ~ May. 2020 expected).  

I plan to apply for a PhD program in the United States (2020 fall semester).

My current interest includes:  
* Statistics
  * High dimensional Statistics, Nonparametric Statistics, Statistical Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics
* Computer Science
  * Algorithm Engineering, Deep Learning

Also, I am working hard and having fun strengthening my [mathematical](https://austinyi.github.io/notes/) background these days.
Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing soccer and watching MLB and EPL on TV.

Feel free to email me at austinyi (at) snu (dot) ac (dot) kr. A copy of my CV is available [here](https://austinyi.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).
